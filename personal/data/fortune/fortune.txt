;; ***** Special AI Seminar (abstract)
;; It has been widely recognized that AI programs require expert knowledge
;; in order to perform well in complex domains.  But knowledge alone is not
;; sufficient for some applications; wisdom is needed as well.  Accordingly,
;; we have developed a new approach to artificial intelligence which we call
;; "wisdom engineering".  As a test of our ideas, we have written IMMANUEL, a
;; wisdom based system for the task domain of western philosophical thought.
;; IMMANUEL was supplied initially with 200 wisdom units which contained wisdom
;; about such elementary concepts as mind, matter, being, nothingness, and so
;; forth.  IMMANUEL was then allowed to run freely, guided by the heuristic
;; rules contained in its heterarchically organized meta wisdom base.  IMMANUEL
;; succeeded in rediscovering most of the important philosophical ideas developed
;; in western culture over the course of the last 25 centuries, including those
;; underlying Plato's theory of government, Kant's metaphysics, Nietzsche's theory
;; of value, and Husserl's phenomenology.  In this seminar, we will describe
;; IMMANUEL's achievements and internal architecture.  We will also briefly
;; discuss our recent efforts to apply wisdom engineering to oil exploration.

;;     What men, in their imbecility, constantly mistake for a deficiency of

;; minutiae of some sordid and degrading business or profession, say soap selling
;; or the law. But these puerile talents are not really signs of intelligence;
;; they are merely accomplishments, and they differ only in degree from the
;; accomplishments of a trained chimpanzee.
;;     The truth is that the capacity for mastering them is the sign of a petty
;; mind, and Havelock Ellis, in his great study of English genius, shows that men
;; of genius almost invariably lack it. One could not think of Shakespeare or
;; Goethe or Beethoven multiplying 3,456,754 by 79,999 without making a mistake,

;;     That women always try to evade them -- that they have little capacity for

;; slips away, slowly becoming stone-cold from the feet up. It is our fantasy of
;; the normal death, with the addition of social and prophetic implications, to
;; say nothing of heroic proportions. Again, most of us will likely drop dead on a
;; subway platform, in the middle of an orgasm or straining on a toilet seat early
;; in the morning. The real tragedy of death may be just how often it is comic.

;; The principle of maximum diversity operates both at the physical and at the
;; mental level. It says that the laws of nature and the initial conditions are
;; such as to make the universe as interesting as possible. As a result, life is
;; possible but not too easy. Always when things are dull, something new turns up
;; to challenge us and to stop us from settling into a rut. Examples of things
;; which make life difficult are all around us: comet impacts, ice ages, weapons,
;; plagues, nuclear fission, computers, sex, sin and death. Not all challenges can
;; be overcome, and so we have tragedy. Maximum diversity often leads to maximum
;; stress. In the end we survive, but only by the skin of our teeth.

;; There are men who serve us, like the consul at Trollesund. And there are men we

;; front of our eyes like butterflies, creatures of a brief season. We love them;
;; they are brave, proud, beautiful, clever; and they die almost at once. They die
;; so soon that our hearts are continually racked with pain. We bear their
;; children, who are witches if they are female, human if not; and then in the
;; blink of an eye they are gone, felled, slain, lost. Our sons, too. When a
;; little boy is growing, he thinks he is immortal. His mother knows he isn't.
;; Each time becomes more painful, until finally your heart is broken. Perhaps
;; that is when Yambe-Akka comes for you. She is older than the tundra. Perhaps,
;; for her, witches' lives are as brief as men's are to us.
