;; Visual bookmarks mode
(prelude-require-package 'bm)
(prelude-require-package 'helm-bm)

;; location of the persistent bookmarks
(setq bm-repository-file (concat temporary-file-directory "bm-repository"))

;; Put bookmarks on the fringe
(setq bm-highlight-style 'bm-highlight-only-fringe)

;; cycle across buffers
(setq bm-cycle-all-buffers t)

;; repository should be restored when loading `bm'
(setq bm-restore-repository-on-load t)

;; buffer should be recentered around the bookmark
(setq bm-recenter t)

;; make bookmarks persistent as default
(setq-default bm-buffer-persistence t)

;; FIXME: for some reason the hooks don't work with prelude.

;; loading the repository from file when on start up
;(add-hook' after-init-hook 'bm-repository-load)

;; restoring bookmarks when on file find
;(add-hook 'find-file-hooks 'bm-buffer-restore)

;; saving bookmark data on killing a buffer
;(add-hook 'kill-buffer-hook 'bm-buffer-save)

;; saving the repository to file when on exit
;; `kill-buffer-hook' is not called when emacs is killed, so we
;; must save all bookmarks first
